## ðŸ“– About the Application

**Jobby App** is a job search application built with React.  
It allows users to log in, explore job opportunities, and view job details with filters and search options.  

The application integrates with external APIs to fetch data such as user profile details, job listings, and job descriptions. It demonstrates the use of authentication, protected routes, API calls, and responsive UI design.  

### Key Highlights:
- **Authentication:** Users must log in using valid credentials to access the application.
- **Profile Section:** Displays user profile details fetched from the API.
- **Jobs Listing:** Users can browse through available jobs with filters like:
  - Employment Type (Full Time, Part Time, Internship, Freelance)
  - Salary Range
  - Search by job title
  - Locations (Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai)
- **Job Details:** Each job has a dedicated details page showing:
  - Company information
  - Job description
  - Required skills
  - Life at company
  - Similar job recommendations
- **Error Handling:** Proper error views are shown when API requests fail, with an option to retry.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Navigation:** A header with navigation links and logout functionality.

This project is a practical implementation of real-world features found in job portal applications such as Naukri, Indeed, or LinkedIn Jobs.
